# Unemployment-in-Canada-by-Province

The "Unemployment in Canada" dataset provides a comprehensive view of employment and unemployment dynamics across various provinces and age groups in Canada. Organized chronologically, each entry represents a specific month and year, allowing for temporal analysis. The dataset's geographical breakdown encompasses provinces such as Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and a consolidated entry for Canada. Age groups, ranging from 15 to 24 years to 55 years and over, provide granularity for segment-specific insights. Key metrics include total employment, full-time and part-time employment, the overall labor force, and the number of unemployed individuals. Population metrics offer context to the labor market size, and rate metrics, such as employment rate, participation rate, and unemployment rate, provide a nuanced understanding of the employment landscape. This dataset facilitates exploratory data analysis to uncover temporal trends, regional disparities, and age-related variations in employment, offering valuable insights for researchers and policymakers seeking to understand and address labor market challenges in Canada.
